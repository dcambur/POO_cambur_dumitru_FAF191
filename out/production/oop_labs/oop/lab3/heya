I have learned how to become vicious, and I have slaughtered during my more than thousand years of cultivation.
I have also learned loneliness, but I have lost far too much...
I have lost my parents, my family, my lover, my child, my happiness, my everything!
Sometimes, I ask myself â€˜what am I after!
